Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile health (mHealth) interventions delivered via smartphones. In practice, the assumptions required for MRTs are often difficult to satisfy: randomization probabilities can be uncertain, observations are frequently incomplete, and prespecifying features from high-dimensional contexts for linear working models is also challenging.

To address these issues, the **doubly robust weighted centered least squares (DR-WCLS)** framework provides a flexible procedure for variable selection and inference. The methods incorporate supervised learning algorithms and enable valid inference on time-varying causal effects in longitudinal settings. The **DR_WCLS_LASSO** R package implements post-selection inference with LASSO in this framework.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub:

```r
require("remotes")
remotes::install_github("WHD-Lab/DR_WCLS_LASSO")
```

Then run:

```r
library(devtools)
install()
```

## Quick Start

To configure a Python virtual environment in R, run:

```r
library(MRTpostInfLASSO)

# Configure virtual environment
venv_info = venv_config()
venv = venv_info$hash
print(venv)

# Do the python deps load?
library(reticulate)
np = import("numpy", convert = FALSE)
lasso_mod = import("selectinf.randomized.lasso", convert = FALSE)$lasso

# Simple test
run_simple_lasso_test_snigdha_fixed(venv)
```

Or, if already configured, use:

```r
library(reticulate)
use_virtualenv("a9c268bc", required = TRUE)
np = import("numpy", convert = FALSE)
lassopy = import("selectinf.randomized.lasso", convert = FALSE)$lasso
selected_targets = import("selectinf.base", convert = FALSE)$selected_targets
const = lassopy$gaussian
exact_grid_inference = import("selectinf.randomized.exact_reference", convert = FALSE)$exact_grid_inference
```
